# qtcreeper

Originally a [fork from the qtcreeper pyhton script](https://github.com/megustalafantabienfria/qtcreeper) where I was supossed to make a port to JS just for fun.

This work with a Chromium instance installed by puppeteer, I choosed to use it for two reasons: I wanted to test it and learn a bit about it and I never made work those request libraries with cached cookies and stuff.
